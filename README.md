## A. PROJECT SUMMARY

**Project Title:** Cartoonify image

**Team Members:** 
-  Afza Adawiyah Bt Abdul Tahrim
- Nur Aisya Fatihah Bt Azhar
- Nur Syahirah Bt Mohd Izwan Wasandan
- Nur Afiqah Bt Halim


- [ ] **Objectives:**
- Break out the project goal into more specific objectives
- to convert a 3D image into a 2D image
- To change an original image into a new one


##  B. ABSTRACT 

Cartoon are wildly used in animations films. that it became a source of income and entertainment that is important to a community of people in the film industry and comic books adaptations. To produce an animation requires long hours to animate a scene full of backgrounds and plenty of character's movements, thus if the process to cartoonify a real camera-captured scenery into a cartoon image, should lessen half of the animation production.

## F.  RESULT AND CONCLUSION

You can convert real life image with OpenCV in real-time using the following steps:

- Open cartoonifyImage.py
- Open the windows..
- Choose images from computer
- Converting the image
- Save the conrtoonified image


## G.   PROJECT PRESENTATION 
In this project, we learned how to convert real life image into cartoon using OpenCV.
We also learned about how to smoothen the lines and masking the images to make it less realistic and cartoonify it.

Other than that, we learned how to import the picture into the program to cartoonify it and enables save option after the conversion.
